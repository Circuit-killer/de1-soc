NOTE: remeber to program the FPGA with the script and rbf file in linux_utilities

In this folder:

 - blinker_without_kernel_module: it is a program that can access the custom component on FPGA
   as a super user, witout the need of a kernel module, acting directly on /dev/mem (non safe)

 - kernel_module: is the kernel module that make the custom module visible as a file to a user 
   space task

 - blinker_with_kernel_module: is the user space task that access the kernel module. 
   Use as ./executable [1-9] to accelerate/decelerate blinking
